This is a project for Telus. 

This project is built by react, and typeScirpt

It loads data from the json file

<b>It did not check if there is any duplicate data. </b> 

and then display it on a table and you can sort and search

To run the project<br/>
1. please run <b>npm install</b> <br/>
2. <b>npm start</b>

In the real world, if it is a much bigger data set, i will set redux or any other state management system to handle data and may suggest to use GraphQl to handle what data need to be loaded
